 <h2> <p> <b>Machine Learning based Performance and Power prediction of NoCs  </b> </p> </h2>
<p align="justify">
Performance accurate software simulators are generally too slow for interactive use. We are building a machine learning framework that uses existing results of the simulators (Booksim 2.0 and Orion) and predicts the overall performance and power of the NoC. Such a framework can potentially save simulation time while evaluating options from a large design space.</p>

<h2> <p> <b>Design of an Efficient 3D-NoC Architecture for Modern Processors </b> </p> </h2>

<p align="justify"> NoCs on 3D ICs technology provides an opportunity to better the on chip communication delay, energy and area parameters compared to the 2D-NoCs. We are extending the existing simulators to support 3D-NoC topologies. Design space exploration of 3D-NoC is being driven by considering physical characteristics of vertical connections like Through Silicon Vias (TSVs). The exploration is aided using power, performance and cost metrics such as area, throughput, avg. flit latency, Energy per bit transferred, and EDP. </p>

<h2> <p> <b>On-Chip Network simulation acceleration using FPGA  </b> </p> </h2>

<p align="justify" > NoC researchers have relied on cycle accurate power and performance simulators (viz. Orion, Garnet, Noxim, SICOSYS, Booksim) to explore the micro-architectural design space of on-chip networks. The NoC parameters such as topology, routing algorithm, flow control, and router micro-architecture, including buffer management and allocation schemes can be analyzed using these simulators. Large scale design space exploration of NoCs can be very time-intensive. To address this issue we propose hardware based acceleration using FPGA to speed up the NoC simulation. Fast and accurate simulators provide a vehicle for the rapid exploration of microprocessor designs. FPGAs are made up of thousands of small interconnected lookup tables that can be used to iterate easily in an incremental design debug cycle similar to software development life cycle. Therefore, FPGA accelerated simulators are faster than the software-only simulators. </p>

<h2> <p> <b>GPU-based heuristic approaches to solve TSP</b> </p> </h2>

<p align="justify" > Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-hard, O(n!) , combinatorial optimization problem. The time complexity of TSP is factorial time when solved using brute-force method and exponential time when solved using dynamic programming. For its large number of applications in science and engineering, time efficient TSP solutions are of great importance. Since exact methods are prohibitive for large city instances, heuristic  approaches gives  a near-optimal solution by exploring limited search space in a reasonable amount of time. Although heuristic methods to solve TSP are faster than the exact methods, the execution time increases as input size increases. For large input sizes, GPU implementation of TSP have been shown to complete in a reasonable amount of time. </p>

<p> Remote Sensing systems, particularly those deployed on satellites, provide a repetitive and consistent view of the Earth. To meet the needs of different remote sensing applications the systems offer a wide range of spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions. Satellites usually take several images from frequency bands in the visual and non-visual range</p>

<h2> <p> <b> 1. Fast Large Graph Algorithms on GPU  </b> </p> </h2>

<p align="justify" > Efficient and fast graph algorithms find applications in real-world problems in a wide variety of areas
such as complex systems, sociology, biology, physics, network analysis and others.GPUs provide programming flexibility in terms of number of threads per block, number of
blocks per kernel, and use of virtual warps to obtain optimal performance. In this paper, we provide
fast GPU implementations of algorithms to calculate Characteristic Path Length, Diameter, Close-
ness Centrality, Harmonic Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, Degree Centrality, and Eigenvector
Centrality in large, sparse graphs. </p>

<h2> <p> <b> 2. Comparative study of mapping and partitioning algorithms for energy
consumption reduction on NoC based MPSoC  </b> </p> </h2>

<p align="justify" > Modern applications require heavy computa- tion power, good performance, flexibility, less energy con- sumption and reduced bandwidth usage. NoC based SoCs are designed to satisfy all these needs. The performance of an application tasks depends upon communication in- frastructure, routing policies, power management, parti- tion and mapping algorithms, contention control policies, etc of the NoC design. This paper is focusing on partition and mapping methodologies that is a crucial element that affects the communication and energy consumption. Parti- tion is the grouping of tasks that are having more affinity depending upon communication, bandwidth usage</p>
